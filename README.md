1.) How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

There are a few things I can do to make sure my code is funcitonal and secure. First is to do the obvious, writing code that is easy to read and understand using consistent formatting, variable names, and comments to make the code as clear as possible. Next is to test the code, ideally with automated testing tools in order to catch run time error and bugs. And finally I want to make sure im using secure coding practices.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret users needs in the requirement review process. I must ask the user to thourougly break down what they need functionally then reverse engineer the idea in the requirement design process. Its always efficient to think about the testing process in this stage.

How do I approach designing software?

First, before any code is written, you want to thourougly go over the requirements of the software. There are few feelings worse than spending valuable time and money on a program that does not perform, or has extra reduntant functions from what the user needs. Next is to design based on the user requirements, implemet some flow charts and pseudocode, then begin the coding process. Once this is done you want to test all edge cases you can think of.
